## Hello All Who Have Come Across This Repository 
Before you begin your use of this repository there are a couple important things to note 
- You will likely need to download the Arduino IDE to upload/run the Arduino code on your device.
- You will also likely need to download some other IDE (I used Pycharm) to run the Python program.

That is all, happy programming!
